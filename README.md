## Experience
### Data scientist - Visma  
_January 2020 - Now_

Since 2020 I have been working as a data scientist on the automation of processes by means of machine learning. The work involves the entire process, from data exploration and model training to integration with the necessary systems. An example of this is the ticket classification solution that spares the service desk from allocating 300 tickets per week.  

A more recent project is a reporting tool that can be used to search documents using the latest NLP techniques. Those results are then automatically rewritten into a piece of text for reporting purposes. Important here is the trade-off between accuracy and the lead time of the process.  

Our team is also responsible for helping Team Jumbo-Visma with machine learning solutions. For the cycling team we provide a calorie prediction and a talent identification solution. We are working with students from the University of Maastricht to further develop this. As part of this I have supervised the students during their internship period and with the their thesis.  

### Data modeler (XBRL) - Thauris / EBPI / Visma  
_March 2016 - January 2020_

XBRL is an XML-based specification for data exchange. XBRL defines what and how to report. As a data modeler I was responsible for delivering technically and substantively high-quality XBRL. For me, the focus has always been on continuing to develop work processes to increase the efficiency and quality of the end product.  

In addition to my work as a data modeler, I was the product owner of an XBRL development tool during this period. This tool had to continue to meet expectations when designing increasingly larger and complex XBRL. If the limits of the software were encountered, it was important to be creative to find a solution.
